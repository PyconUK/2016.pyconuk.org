        <p>Most of the global software industry is dominated by a very narrow demographic, of young, white, western men. This imbalance isn't good for anyone, and we want PyCon UK 2016 to be a milestone in the effort to address it.</p>

<p>We will be making every effort to hold as inclusive an event as possible, and to shift the demographic of our audience and speakers. This is not just a vague aim, <a href="/diversity-target/">it's a clear target</a>.</p>

<h2>Code of conduct</h2>
<p>Like every PyCon, we have a prominent <a href="/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a> <strong>that will be enforced</strong>.</p>

<h2>Minorities in our community</h2>
<p>It's not simply iniquitous that the minorities of our community - for example, women, people of non-European descent, people with disabilities - find it harder to participate in it: their participation is vital to its health and needed now more than ever.</p>

<p>If you belong to one of these or any other under-represented groups, we’re especially keen to have you at PyCon UK. We want to help redress the imbalance, make a clear statement about your value to the community and affirm your position as a first-class citizen of it.</p>


<h2>Django Girls</h2>
<p>There'll be a day-long <a href="/djangogirls/">Django Girls</a> workshop at PyCon UK. Since the first Django Girls event in July 2014, thousands of women have been introduced to Django and Python through these free workshops.</p>

<p>Free conference tickets for PyCon UK will be given to DjangoGirls attendees. These are full tickets, and include lunches, refreshments and everything else that the conference has to offer.</p>

<p>The workshop will be oversubscribed; places will be allocated by the Django Girls organisers.</p>

<p>To register your interest in attending, please <a href="https://djangogirls.org/pyconuk2016/apply/">fill in
the application form</a>.</p>

<h2>Trans*Code</h2>
<p>Trans*Code will be running a hackday at the event.</p>

<p>The Trans*Code event is an opportunity to work with others on projects and issues that particularly affect the trans community.</p>

<h2>Financial assistance</h2>
<p>We will be supporting individuals who need help to meet the costs of travel, subsistence or even taking days off work. This will include discounted or free conference tickets. <em>Speakers will automatically be eligible for this assistance if they require it.</em></p>

<h3>Apply for financial assistance</h3>
<p>We have set aside a considerable sum for financial assistance.</p>

<p><em>Don't be reluctant to apply for financial assistance.</em> Many of your fellow speakers and some members of the committee will be doing the same. The money is there to help <strong>you</strong>.</p>

<h2>Donations towards financial assistance</h2>
<p>When buying your own ticket, you can can make a donation to buy a ticket on behalf of an attendee who couldn’t otherwise afford it. These tickets will be allocated by an awards committee, and you or your organisation will be - unless you state otherwise - thanked publicly for your generous support.</p>

<h2>Mobility</h2>

<p>The PyCon UK venue is fully <strong>wheelchair-accessible</strong> and has:</p>

<ul>
<li>step-free access from the street and car-parks</li>
<li>step-free access to all auditoriums, theatres and halls</li>
<li>toilets suitable for wheelchair users</li>
</ul>

<p>Please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> about any mobility assistance needs you may have during your stay in Cardiff.</p>

<h2>Visual impairments</h2>
<p><strong>Preferred seating</strong> will be provided and reserved for the visually-impaired. Please contact us about any lighting requirements you may have, and we will do our best to meet them.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you would benefit from having a <strong>close-up display of presenters’ slides and screens</strong>, or from the provision of any <strong>assistive technology</strong>, just let us know.</p>
<p><strong>Guide dogs</strong> are welcome at the conference and social events.</p>

<h2>Hearing impairments</h2>
<p>All talks will be held in auditoriums with <strong>induction loops for hearing aid users</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition, talks will feature <strong>simultaneous speech-to-text transcription</strong>, which will also be used for subtitling the conference videos that are subsequently published.</p>

<p>On request, we will provide a British Sign Language interpreter (at no charge) for the duration of the conference to any Deaf attendees, to help them participate more fully in discussions and social events.</p>

<p>Please note that while BSL shares significant similarity with Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language, it is quite distinct from American Sign Language. However, we will do our best to meet any request for other sign language interpreters - <a href="/contact/">so please just ask</a>.</p>

<h2>Crèche</h2>
<p>We will provide a <strong>free crèche</strong>, staffed by registered and qualified childminders, during conference hours.</p>

<p>You will need to register well in advance for the crèche.</p>

<p>Children will be welcome at all appropriate conference events, during breaks for refreshments <em>and in the audience at talks</em>.</p>

<p>If your child is old enough to have meals and refreshments with us, they are welcome to join us.</p>

<p>If they are not, you will need to provide their food.</p>

<h3>Breastfeeding at PyCon UK</h3>
<p>If you are breastfeeding your baby, we can provide a quiet room <strong>if that’s what you prefer</strong>. Otherwise, <strong>please feed your baby whenever and wherever you like</strong>, including during talks and at meal-times. PyCon UK will be a friendly environment for parents and babies.</p>

<h2>Dietary requirements</h2>
<p>We aim to meet <strong>all dietary requirements</strong>. You will be able to specify these when purchasing your ticket.</p>

<h2>Quiet room</h2>
<p>We will provide a clearly-marked designated quiet room at all venues. This room is intended to be a calm and quiet place for anyone who needs to have a break from the bustle of the conference, and will not be used for socialising.</p>

<h2>Clothing</h2>
<p>At PyCon UK we want everyone to feel comfortable, and that includes wearing clothing that makes you feel comfortable. For that reason, PyCon UK <strong>does not have a formal dress code</strong>. As long as your outfit is not illegal and does not violate the <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>, <strong>you are welcome to wear whatever suits you best</strong>, whether that is national costume, religious dress, business suits, or any other preferred form of dress or decoration.</p>

<h2>Faith</h2>
<p>PyCon UK is fortunate to have delegates from all walks of life, including delegates from many different faith backgrounds. While PyCon UK itself is a secular event, it is extremely important to us that our delegates are able to satisfy their spiritual needs as well as their physical ones. Happily, Cardiff is a multicultural city with places of worship for many different faiths. If you are in search of an appropriate place of worship, a quick internet search will locate one: alternatively, if you need more assistance, <a href="http://www.visitcardiff.com/discover/touristinformationcentre/">Cardiff tourist information</a> will gladly help you find what you need.</p>

<h2>Is something missing?</h2>
<p>Have we neglected something you need, or is there something not mentioned here that would make your attendance possible, or improve your experience of the event? <a href="/contact/">Please let us know</a>. We'll do what can to provide it.</p>
