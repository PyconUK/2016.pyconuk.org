callout_big_2: the support of our sponsors
---

Sponsoring PyCon UK is a great way for your company to support the Python
community, promote your products, and meet Python developers who are looking
for work.

We couldn't run the conference without the generous support of our sponsors.
In return, we will ensure that our your company is given exposure before,
during, and after the conference, and we will work with you so that you get
exactly you're looking for out of sponsoring the conference.


## Benefits

We offer free tickets to all sponsors.

We will promote sponsors before the conference through social media and in the
conference newsletter.  In addition, your logo will be placed on the conference
website and on signs around the conference venue, and you will be able to
advertise in the conference booklet.

Your company will be able to set up a booth in the central [Marble
Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/rooms/marble-hall) to allow you to
interact with attendees for the duration of the conference.

We run a jobs fair over the Sunday lunchtime, allowing sponsors to meet with
conference attendees who are (or expect to be soon) looking for work.

In addition, if you are a gold or silver sponsor, you will be offered time in
the programme to give a presentation about a topic of your choice.

There are three available levels of sponsorship:

* Gold sponsorship costs £9,995.  You will be eligible for ten free tickets,
  and will be invited to give a fifteen-minute sponsored keynote on any
  appropriate topic during the conference.

  and will be invited to give a five-minute sponsored lightning talk during the
