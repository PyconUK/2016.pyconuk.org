<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>
    Attending a conference is an exciting and valuable way to get involved with
    a community. It provides delegates with an opportunity to spend time with
    their peers in a setting that allows the sharing of ideas, and exposes
    people to opportunities and challenges that they may not otherwise get to
    see. And above all else, it offers an opportunity to relax with and enjoy
    the company of the wonderful people in our community!
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, many members of our community are unable to take advantage
    of this kind of opportunity for financial reasons. Attending a conference
    is expensive, both in terms of explicit financial costs like ticket prices
    and travel, but also in terms of implicit costs like loss of time or the
    need to find childcare.
</p>

<p>
    These limitations mean that our community is unevenly exposed to the
    benefits of conference attendance. This limits us: as long as only a subset
    of our community are able to attend, we will be missing important
    perspectives that make our events and lives richer.
</p>

<p>
    For this reason, PyCon UK believes it is extremely important to enable as
    many people as possible to attend. To this end, we are offering extensive
    assistance in the form of financial aid. The goal of this program is to
    enable people to attend who would like to, but cannot bear the financial
    burden of attending.
</p>

<p>
    Going hand-in-hand with the financial aid process is the other core tenet
    of PyCon UK: <em>everybody pays</em>. This applies truly to everyone: by
    default, PyCon UK asks that everybody buys a ticket, including the PyCon UK
    Committee, all speakers, and all volunteers. This system allows us to
    support our substantial financial aid process, and ensures that discounted
    admission is not granted to those who do not need it.
</p>

<p>
    This means that it is <strong>extremely important</strong> that attendees
    are proactive about applying for financial aid. If the only reason you are
    not attending is that you cannot afford to do so, then
    <strong>please</strong> apply for financial aid. You can find instructions
    for doing so below.

<p>
    Please note that you <strong>do not</strong> need to have purchased a
    ticket before applying for financial aid. On our financial aid form you'll
    be able to ask that a ticket be set aside for you, conditional on your
    grant being processed.
