The main conference runs from Friday 16th to Monday 19th September, with tickets costing:

 * £96 if you are paying for your own ticket;
 * £144 if your employer is paying for your ticket.

There are cheaper tickets if you can only come for some days, but we hope that you'll come for the whole conference!

Entrance to the [Open Day](/open-day/) on Thursday is free of charge, but you'll still need to register for an Open Day ticket.

[Financial assistance](/financial-aid/) is available to help cover ticket costs for
those who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend the conference.

When buying a ticket, you can make a donation towards our financial assistance budget.
Every penny donated will be used to support the attendance of somebody who would otherwise find it hard to afford to come to the conference.

If you have already bought a ticket, but would like to upgrade it (perhaps from a 3-day ticket to a 4-day ticket, or from a self-funded ticket to an employer-funded ticket), please [purchase an upgrade](/tickets/upgrading/).
