callout_big_1: PyCon UK is your community-led
callout_big_2: volunteer-run conference
callout_small: Cardiff City Hall from Thursday 15th to Monday 19th September 2016
---

PyCon UK is the annual gathering of the UK Python community and its friends
from around the world.  This year, the conference is held at [Cardiff City
Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/), from Thursday 15th to Monday 19th
September.

We&rsquo;ll be putting on a programme of talks, workshops and other events
aimed at the whole Python community, from web developers to hardware engineers,
from professionals to hobbyists.  There will be an [education
programme](/teachers/) for teachers and an [expanded research
programme](/research/) aimed at researchers from the humanities, arts and
scientists.

We&rsquo;re a community&hyphen;led, volunteer&hyphen;run conference and this
means we want you to be involved.  If you&rsquo;d like to give a talk or run a
workshop, please see our [Call For Proposals](/cfp/).  We&rsquo;re particularly
keen to hear from under&hyphen;represented groups and first&hyphen;time
speakers.

Through the generosity of our sponsors, we&rsquo;re able to make the conference
more affordable than in recent years, with individual [tickets](/tickets/) only
&pound;96.  For the first time, we&rsquo;re also offering a [Financial Aid
Programme](/financial-aid/).

PyCon UK cannot happen without sponsors.  If you or your company are interested
in supporting the conference &mdash; perhaps you&rsquo;re recruiting, or sell
to developers, or want to give something back to the community &mdash; take a
look at our [sponsorship options](/sponsorship/).

We&rsquo;re committed to ensuring the conference is welcoming, enjoyable and
safe for everyone, so we expect all attendees to agree to our [Code of
Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

If you&rsquo;ve got any questions, [get in touch](/contact/).

We look forward to seeing you in September!
