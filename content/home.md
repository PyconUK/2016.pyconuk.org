callout_big_1: PyCon UK is your community-led
callout_big_2: volunteer-run conference
callout_small: Cardiff City Hall from Thursday 15th to Monday 19th September 2016
---

PyCon UK is the annual gathering of the UK Python community and its friends
from around the world.  This year, the conference is held at [Cardiff City
Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/), from Thursday 15th to Monday 19th
September.

We&rsquo;ll be putting on a programme of talks, workshops, and other events
aimed at the whole Python community, from web developers to hardware engineers,
from professionals to hobbyists.  There will be an education programme for
teachers, and an expanded research programme aimed at scientists and
researchers.

We&rsquo;re a community&hyphen;led, volunteer&hyphen;run conference, and this
means we want you to be involved.  If you&rsquo;d like to give a talk or run a
workshop, please see our [Call For Proposals](/cfp/).  We&rsquo;re particularly
keen to hear from under&hyphen;represented groups and first&hyphen;time
speakers.

Through the generosity of our sponsors, we&rsquo;re able to make the conference
more affordable than in recent years, with individual [tickets](/tickets/) only
&pound;99.  For the first time, we&rsquo;re also offering a [Financial Aid
Programme](/financial-aid/).

PyCon UK cannot happen without sponsors.  If you or your company are interested
in supporting the conference &mdash; perhaps you&rsquo;re recruiting, or sell
to developers, or want to give something back to the community &mdash; take a
look at our [sponsorship options](/sponsorship/).

We&rsquo;re committed to ensuring the conference is welcoming, enjoyable, and
safe for everyone, and so we expect all attendees to agree to our [Code of
Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

If you&rsquo;ve got any questions, [get in touch](/contact/).

We look forward to seeing you in September!
