Our [Call for proposals](/cfp) will be closing soon - on the 28th June.

If you're thinking about submitting a proposal for a talk, workshop or other activity - please do! And do please get
in touch with us to discuss your proposal if you think that would help.

Don't forget that we have a [Speaker mentor programme](/speaker-mentors) to help first-time speakers or anyone else
who would benefit from some help of that kind.

In order to encourage you, here are five speakers we've chosen as a preview in advance of the final selection:

### Cat Lamin, *Why do kids need to code and how can we help?*

[Cat](https://teachprimarycomputing.wordpress.com) is a maths and computing teacher, with huge enthusiasm for programming and technology, and an awareness of some of
the problems in comupting education: "There is a huge disparity between expectations for teaching computing and what
teachers actually know how to do".

### Thomas Campbell, *Using Python for National Cipher Challenge*

Thomas is a high-school pupil, for whom Python has already unlocked several doors (almost literally, in cryptography)
and presents many more opportunities as a tool for exploring the world.

### Yulia Zozulya, *From QA to UX - Learning how to accommodate developers*

Yulia works at [JetBrains](http://jetbrains.com), producers of one of the most widely-used of all Python development
tools, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), so she gets some very clear insights into how developers behave
when they're users; she'll share these and discuss the challenge of creating tools for this special class of users.

### Gusztav Belteki, *Python in Medicine: ventilator data*

[Gustav](http://www.belteki.co.uk) is a consultant neonatologist, with expertise in the computer-controlled ventilators
that assist the breathing of very ill new-born babies. He's a self-described Python hobbyist, with no programming
background, but has been using Python to explore and analyse the vast amounts of useful data these machines produce to
improve patient outcomes.

### Zara Siddique, *Addition: It can actually get quite complicated*

Zara is a mathematician, and she uses Python as a computing tool of choice to tackle mathematical problems. Maths is
filled with apparently simple problems that rapidly turn out to be not simple at all. Addition is one of them. Zara
will discuss amongst other things the [Scholz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholz_conjecture) and how
she has used Python to explore it.

### What about you?

You too could be speaking at PyCon UK. The last thing you need to be is an expert: all you need is to have something
interesting to say.
