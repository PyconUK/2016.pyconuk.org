title: Teachers at PyCon UK
callout_big_1: A one-day mini-conference about
callout_big_2: Python in the classroom
callout_small: Friday 16th September
---

We&rsquo;re pleased to welcome teachers back to PyCon UK for a day of training,
collaboration, and networking, in partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

Now in its fifth year, PyCon UK&rsquo;s day for teachers gives teachers the
chance to meet with and learn from developers, and developers the chance to
share their expertise and contribute to the development of resources for the
classroom.

Once again, we&rsquo;re able to offer bursaries of **&pound;200 per teacher**,
towards the cost of supply cover at school.

Activities will include:

 * an introductory Python workshop;
 * &ldquo;Adopt a Teacher&rdquo;, for building long-term relationships between
   teachers and developers;
 * workshops on using Python in the classroom with the micro:bit and Raspberry
   Pi;
 * a TeachMeet;
 * ...and a lot more!

Teachers are invited to come for the whole weekend and take part in the main
conference, where there will be sessions and activities aimed at all Python
programmers of all backgrounds and abilities.  Day tickets are available for
those who are only able to come for one day.

open by 1st May.
