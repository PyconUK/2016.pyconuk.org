Since the first Django Girls event in July 2014, thousands of women have been introduced to Django and
Python through these free workshops.

Their mission is to bring more amazing women into the world of technology and increase the diversity of our community. They believe that technology is for people and everyone should be able to build it. They make technology more approachable by creating simple tools and resources designed with empathy.

Free conference tickets for PyCon UK will be given to DjangoGirls attendees. These are full tickets, and include lunches, refreshments and everything else that the conference has to offer.

The workshop will be oversubscribed; places will be allocated by the Django Girls organisers.
