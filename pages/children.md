Our day for children is back!

We're hosting a fun-packed day of activities and workshops for children to
learn all about getting the most out of the world with Python.

This year we're working with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Code Club and some of the team who
brought Python to the BBC Micro:bit. They will be coming along to show you how use Python
to write your first computer program, your very own electronic games and how to hack Minecraft!  There'll be a chance to play with robots, and to learn about physical computing with the Raspberry Pi and BBC Micro:bit. 

It doesn't matter if you've never programmed a computer before!  We'll have
lots of volunteers on hand to show you what you need to know.

## Activities

There is an activity for everyone on our children's day, whether you are learning for the first time or already have experience of programming:

### Intro to Python with Code Club

Learn how to code Python perhaps for the first time in this session with Code
Club, before embarking on projects in the afternoon!

### Do something else in Python...

Take Python programming beyond the screen and control real world physical
objects with experts from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. A session for children already comfortable with Python basics.

### Hacking Minecraft for Beginners

Get your first taste of programming the world of Minecraft using Python. Great
for those new to Python programming.

### Pygame Zero: Build a game with Python

Want to be a games developer? Then use your Python skills to make your very own
game.

### BBC micro:bit Mayhem

Bring your BBC micro:bit along or play with one of ours to create a Dalek or
control Minecraft! Fun for kids and adults.

### Python for Parents

That's right, a session for parent's of young coders because you have no idea what just happened but now your kids are enthusiastic
and keep asking questions!
