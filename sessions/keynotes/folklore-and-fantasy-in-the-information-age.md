Software development is not easy.

As grown-ups we know better than to believe that difficult things can be
achieved by a simple wave of a magic wand, yet faith persists that this new
idea, that new tool, will make all the difference.

Meanwhile for the hard-bitten cynics it is all the emperor's new clothes. I
invite you to join me in a more constructive realm between belief and cynicism,
where we can embrace the power of stories, listen with an open mind, but not be
bewitched by the expectation of a fairy-tale ending.
