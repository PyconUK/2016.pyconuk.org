Accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers are suddenly everywhere -- in phones, wearables, and even in the BBC micro:bit. They are cheap, ultra-low power, and often can be read remotely using Bluetooth Low Energy. In this talk, learn how Python can help you: 
- collect raw multi-axis data in real time; 
- combine them optimally into a useful representation for analysis; 
- deal with noisy and missing data with Kalman filters; and 
- extract high-level gesture information. 
The talk will include examples using MetaWear CPRO wearables and the BBC micro:bit.
