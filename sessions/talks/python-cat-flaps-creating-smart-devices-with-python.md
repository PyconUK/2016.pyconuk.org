Want to run Python on your toaster,  build a smart cat flap, or monitor a squirrel in a tree? With a live visualisation of data collected from the streets of Cardiff learn how to use Python to build a wireless smart gadget. Using the ThingsNetwork in Manchester as a case study of creating a smart, connected city and a wildlife monitoring project in the rural environment, the talk will consider radio communications and coding for low power. Through practical demonstrations, discover the challenges of literally running Python in the field!
