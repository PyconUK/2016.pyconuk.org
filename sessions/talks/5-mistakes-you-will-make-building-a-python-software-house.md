In 2005 I became keen on programming in Python, but at the time there were no job opportunities for Python developers in Poland.

Thatâ€™s why I decided to start my own Python Software House, and today I employ more than 200 people, including over 100 Python developers. Over 11 years of experience in company leadership allows me to see this career path from a wider perspective.

I realize now, how easy it is to make wrong decisions, underestimate threats or undervalue opportunities.

I will gladly share some lessons learnt from working with more than 100 clients, dozens of Python frameworks, and last but not least, a great number of talented developers.
