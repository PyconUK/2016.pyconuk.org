We rightly talk a lot about diversity in technology these days. One area that seems to be neglected is to do with neurodiversity: the acknowledgement of neurological diversity as a result of Autism Spectrum, ADHD, Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Tourette Syndrome, and more.

"Neurodiversity may be every bit as crucial for the human race as biodiversity is for life in general. Who can say what form of wiring will prove best at any given moment? Cybernetics and computer culture, for example, may favor a somewhat autistic cast of mind." - Harvey Blume

I hope to provide an introduction to this large and complex subject, with particular reference to autism and its hidden contribution to computing. Disclaimer: I am considered neurotypical and am not an expert!
