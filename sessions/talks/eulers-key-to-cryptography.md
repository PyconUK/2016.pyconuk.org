Cryptography lies at the heart of the modern era; online transactions, authentication and secure network communications all rely on the encryption and decryption of data.
This talk begins with a short introduction to RSA Public Key Cryptography and subsequently explores its mathematical foundations; touching upon Euler's totient function, the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and Modular Exponentiation.
