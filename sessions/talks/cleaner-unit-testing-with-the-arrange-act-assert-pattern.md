My name is James and I've been using the Arrange Act Assert pattern as part of
my daily Test Driven Development practice for a number of years over multiple
projects with different development teams. During this time I've worked to make
my tests as readable, simple and generally Pythonic as possible - and I firmly
believe that the AAA pattern can help us all with this quest.

In this talk I shall:

* Demonstrate the AAA pattern of testing and its benefits.
* Discuss the code smells can arise when using AAA.
* Present some Pythonic (hopefully), object orientated and organised strategies for
  resolving these smells, refactoring for cleaner, more readable and reliable
  tests.

Prerequisites: You should be familiar with the "Red, Green, Refactor" style of
Test Driven Development.
