Python has always been one of the most dynamic languages, and that's the most important factor in making it as flexible and expressive as it is. However, some recent efforts being done to also bring the world of static typing into Python, initially as a 3rd party project called mypy, and currently with some support in the core language in the form of PEP-484.

Will this make Python a more boring, restrictive, and Java-like language? Is this practical given how dynamic python programs are? are the tools ready for production use? are they hard to use? What are the real benefits? My talk intends to give some background and answer these questions, although
the title should be a spoiler about what the answers will be!
