Developers make peculiar users. We’re very picky on what settings we want, and if we can tweak something we will. This whole idea of “default application settings” rarely applies to us. 
Knowing this, when making tools for developers, we often face many challenges and interesting scenarios on how to best define settings, what the defaults should be and how to make them easily discoverable.
