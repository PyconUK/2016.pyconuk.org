DESCRIPTION:Having access to randomness turns out to be remarkably importan
 t in computing. Whether you’re a scientist working on a simulation\, som
 eone trying to send secret messages\, or just a person who wants to play a
  randomly generated video game level\, having access to some kind of non-d
 eterminism is vital. But computers\, as we all know\, are thoroughly deter
 ministic entities. So how can we get randomness?\n\nThis talk will investi
 gate how randomness works on computers. We’ll introduce you to random nu
 mber generators\, talk about the different kinds that are available and wh
 en to use them\, and then talk about how to get access to random numbers f
 rom your Python code.

DESCRIPTION:Python is very ubiquitous due to its simplicity\, versatility a
 nd enormous library collections. These features make Python the go-to lang
 uage in many domains ranging from science to business used by skilled comp
 uter scientists and people with little to no coding experience.\n\nThis ta
 lk is aimed at complete newcomers to Python\, and at sparking their curios
 ity to explore it\, by showing how much we can achieve with little code in
  fields such as web development\, games\, scientific simulations\, machine
  learning\, cryptography and many others.\n\nFurthermore\, it hopes to ins
 pire the audience to improve its area of expertise with Python\, to explor
 e other domains\, to teach\, to learn\, to create and to engage with the P
 ython community.

  such as 'we'\, 'what'\, and 'for' from text? Or how to extract interestin
 g keywords from a document? Did you know all of this could be done in 10 l

 questions using the open source library [spaCy](http://spacy.io/). One hou
 r spent with us will be useful for anybody who is interested in text proce
 ssing\, text information extraction or text related data science. You will
  leave with the tools and knowledge to start developing your own natural l
 anguage processing projects in Python.\nNo prior experience with NLP or da
 ta science is required for this workshop\, however some Python experience 
 is needed to get the most out of the event. We would like to encourage you
  to install spaCy in advance\, installation instructions can be found at [
 our workshop repo on GitHub](https://github.com/cytora/pycon-nlp-in-10-lin

DESCRIPTION:This tutorial will introduce the audience to the fields of Natu
 ral Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) using a hands-on a
 pproach. Analysing and truly understanding natural language is a difficult
  task\, but Python doesn't fall short in terms of making this topic approa
 chable\, thanks to its rich ecosystem and active community.\n\nFirstly we'
 ll provide an overview on NLP using NLTK\, the Natural Language Toolkit\, 
 one of the most popular Python library for NLP. We'll discuss some of the 
 most important text processing steps and how they impact the quality of ou
 r final application.\n\nWe'll then move on to some notions of word frequen
 cy analysis\, like TF and IDF. All these concepts are going to be applied 
 in the context of a text classification system. Using scikit-learn\, we'll
  understand how to build a classifier\, and how to use it to categorise do
 cuments according to pre-defined labels. We'll briefly discuss how to asse
 ss the quality of our model\, and how we can tune it to achieve better pre
 dictions.\n\nThere are no particular requirements to attend this tutorial\
 , so Python beginners are welcome. Some prior basic notions of machine lea
 rning can be beneficial\, but the theoretical aspects are kept to the bare
  minimum: the aim of this tutorial is to be practical and approachable. At
 tendees are encouraged to bring their own laptop with Python 3\, NLTK and 
 scikit-learn pre-installed (instructions for pip/virtualenv will be provid
 ed\, but please feel free to set up the environment in advance).\n\nLink t

DESCRIPTION:Kubernetes (K8s) is the Google Borg inspired control plane for 
 Docker containers that everyone is talking about. It has a great API but n
 eeds a load of HTTP client code and JSON processing to use it from Python.
  This workshop will quickly get you up to speed on using Kube\, a Python w
 rapper around the K8s API. You'll learn how to connect to the API server f
 or your K8s cluster\; and how to view\, create\, update and delete resourc
 es within it. You'll also learn about Kube's support for the 'Watch' API w
 hich enables your code to respond to resource updates in you K8s cluster.\
 n\nIn preparation for the workshop you should install minikube 0.9.0 on yo
 ur laptop (in my experience this was very easy).  minikube enables you to 
 run a single node Kubernetes cluster - you will be interacting with it usi
 ng kube.  The installation instructions for minikube are on GitHub:\n\n<ht
 tps://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases>\n\nInstallation is possible

DESCRIPTION:Hypothesis is a library for writing smarter tests.\n\nInstead o
 f hand-writing every example in your tests\, you describe what sorts of ex
 amples you need and let it fill in the blanks. It uses this to actively go
  looking for bugs in your code.\n\nIt’s proven very effective\, and is b
 eing used by an ever growing number of open source projects (including pyp
 y\, cryptography\, and mercurial)\, but people sometimes struggle to get s
 tarted.\n\nIn this session we’ll help you overcome that by going through
  a number of illustrative examples that will help you understand this styl
 e of testing better. \n\nEach example will come with a subtly broken imple
 mentation of the problem\, and some basic tests for it. Attendees will the
 n extend these tests using Hypothesis to try to flush out the broken behav
 iour. Afterwards we'll discuss the problems\, how we tested them\, and I'l
 l suggest any useful avenues to explore that I think people missed.\n\nDep
 ending on how people feel and get on\, at the end people will either have 
 a bonus example to explore or are welcome to  bring their own code that th
 ey'd like to test better.\n\nAt the end of this you should feel much more 
 comfortable with the general concepts of property based testing\, and be a
 ble to use Hypothesis effectively to test your own code.\n

DESCRIPTION:High performance computing with Python is usually taken to mean
  using Cython\, Numba\, NumPy\, etc. Using C extensions is usually seen as
  bad move\, and this has affected the idea of using C++ extensions. But wh
 y not use a really good high performance language such as D\, or better st
 ill Chapel. In this workshop we will try things out so that attenders can 
 make their own assessment of whether a multi-language approach works for t
 hem.

DESCRIPTION:\nLearn how to get started with AWS Elastic Beanstalk\, so you 
 can outsource your infrastructure and focus on writing the code unique to 
 you\n\nI think PaaS-en are awesome\, I think more people should be using P
 aaS-en rather than reinventing the wheel poorly\, and I think AWS Elastic 
 Beanstalk is one of the best PaaS-en out there.\n\nIn this workshop I'll g
 uide you through creating an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application (using thei
 r Docker interface) and deploying a basic webapp to it\; I'll walk you thr
 ough various features Elastic Beanstalk provides to make operating\, scali
 ng\, reviewing and debugging your app easier\; finally I'll talk you throu
 gh other AWS services and how you can use those with EB to make things eve
 n more awesome.\n\nYou will need:\n\n* A laptop (or similar)\n* Basic fami
 liarity with Git and GitHub\n* A GitHub account\n* [An AWS account](https:
 //aws.amazon.com/free/)\n\nThings that would be useful\, but are absolutel
 y not required:\n\n* Experience with Docker\n* Experience with CircleCI/Tr
 avisCI or similar\n* Experience with AWS\n\n## Who am I?\n\nI'm Kristian G
 lass and I've been dealing with software in production for the last 15 yea
 rs. \n\nI'm the CTO at LaterPay\, where AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes up a l
 arge chunk of our tech stack\, and prior to that I ran Moorhen Solutions L
 td. - a one-person consultancy where I helped tech teams scale their syste
 ms and infrastructure.\n\nI believe that too many people spend time handro
 lling their own crude PaaS-like systems and should just use someone else's
  - to that end I want you to let me show you the joys of AWS's Elastic Bea
 nstalk\, one of my favourite PaaS-en.\n

DESCRIPTION:#### Jupyter and JupyterLab are great for tinkering and researc

  you want to share them with colleagues who may run them concurrently? Pro
 ductionizing Jupyter notebooks is the new black\, and people have develope
 d various hacks to achieve this. Prefer clean solutions? Then come and joi
 n my talk.   \n\n* I will show how to turn Jupyter notebooks into beautifu
 l web apps without the need to write JavaScript or CSS. In one click. Inte
 rested? Please bear with me.  \n* Looking for a quick REST server? No prob
 lem\, it's a one-liner in Jupyter.  \n* Polling\, scheduling and events in
  notebooks? Can be done too. \n* I will continue to show how real-life use
  cases can be solved using Jupyter in a few lines of code. \n* How many Ju
 pyter magics do you know? I will show a few that can dramatically improve 
 your productivity. \n* Sublime and Jupyter. What's the overlap?\n

DESCRIPTION:Are you curious about building REST APIs and connecting them to
  a frontend application?\nDoes frontend development sound scary or intrigu
 ing?\nWould you like to learn about Django and Django REST Framework?\nIf 
 you answered yes to any of those questions\, come join us for this worksho
 p!\n\nFrontend frameworks are not that different from  backend frameworks.
  They are also MV*\, and even if some of them are very different to what w
 e are used to in the "backend world"\, some of them are really close to wh
 at we are used to with Django.\n\nIf you have no experience with Python\, 
 the MVC pattern or JavaScript at all\, I would recommend that you first go
  through the Django Girls Tutorial  and watch Learn JavaScript in Your PJs
 !  to be able to fully enjoy this workshop.

DESCRIPTION:Relay is a JavaScript framework designed for building data driv
 en front end applications\, using the rendering power of React. It is powe
 red by a GraphQL API\, a new API design which allows clients to dynamicall
 y request the exact shape of data they need. Graphene is a declarative pyt
 hon library which can be used to build a GraphQL API. Together\, this is a
  powerful toolchain for building data driven applications\, especially sui
 ted for those where you have many different ways of presenting the same da
 ta sets.\n\nWe will explore these technologies to build a simple applicati
 on. This tutorial is most suited to developers with an interest in full st
 ack development. A reasonable understanding of modern JavaScript and Djang
 o will be assumed\, but no knowledge of React\, Relay\, GraphQL or Graphen
 e is required.\n

DESCRIPTION:The public sector can use the Digital Marketplace (https://www.
 digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/) to find people and technology for digi
 tal projects. Over £1\,000\,000\,000 has been spent on cloud services by 
 government through the G-Cloud framework since it launched in 2012\, over 
 half of that spend being with SMEs rather than big systems integrators. \n
 \nBack in 2014 the Digital Marketplace was a single Grails application (wr
 itten in Groovy\, running on the JVM) that provided a simple searchable ca
 talogue of cloud services. Applications from suppliers to provide their se
 rvices were handled externally by two separate systems run by the Crown Co
 mmercial Service.\n\nSince then we have rebuilt the Digital Marketplace fr
 om scratch in Python as a RESTful system of Flask applications and expande
 d its functionality to supplant these external systems. It is now on its w
 ay to becoming a general-purpose platform for handling suppliers’ applic
 ations to sell their services to government.\n\nThis talk will explain how
  the the architecture of the system has evolved over a series of iteration
 s of supplier application processes\, and also delve deeper into how we dr
 ive both the frontend applications and data validation from a separate “
 content repository” of YAML files that can be maintained by content desi
 gners rather than developers.

DESCRIPTION:Modern mechanical ventilators are computer-controlled devices w
 hich automatically adapt their functions in order to meet the patient's ne
 eds to achieve synchrony with the patient's own breathing efforts. During 
 this process the ventilator device measures various physical parameters (p
 ressures\, flows\, volumes) at a high sampling frequency (e.g. 100 Hz). I 
 am downloading data from the ventilators over long periods (several days) 
 as comma separated values (.csv) text files. These produces large datasets
 \, that is\, time series data with >10 million time stamps. I have been us
 ing Python and its add-on packages (IPython notebook\, numpy\, pandas\, ma
 tplotlib and scipy) to handle\, analyse\, interpret and visualise these da
 ta. I have developed data analysis pipelines that create various reports a
 bout the mechanical ventilation and ventilation-patient interaction. \n\nI
 n my talk I would like to present some of these workflows as IPython noteb
 ooks. I think anyone who needs to analyse csv or tab-delimited or similar 
 data will find this interesting. I would like people to make people to rea
 lise  that this is a much better and more reproducible way of analysing th
 ese kind of data than trying to use a spreadsheet program. In addition\, I
  would like to show and discuss how I have got here as someone who has no 
 programming background and learned Python in his free time while working i
 n a full time job.

DESCRIPTION:We rightly talk a lot about diversity in technology these days.
  One area that seems to be neglected is to do with neurodiversity: the ack
 nowledgement of neurological diversity as a result of Autism Spectrum\, AD
 HD\, Dyspraxia\, Dyslexia\, Dyscalculia\, Tourette Syndrome\, and more.\n\
 n"Neurodiversity may be every bit as crucial for the human race as biodive
 rsity is for life in general. Who can say what form of wiring will prove b
 est at any given moment? Cybernetics and computer culture\, for example\, 
 may favor a somewhat autistic cast of mind." - Harvey Blume\n\nI hope to p
 rovide an introduction to this large and complex subject\, with particular
  reference to autism and its hidden contribution to computing. Disclaimer:
  I am considered neurotypical and am not an expert!

DESCRIPTION:Each language has its own object-oriented implementation\, that
  can differ in subtle or unexpected ways from others.\n\nNewcomers to Pyth
 on - whether they are coming from another language\, or learning programmi
 ng through Python for the first time - sometimes encounter some ‘strange
 ’ issues\, but understanding Python’s OOP implementation will help mak
 e many of them seem a lot less strange.\n\nThis tutorial will introduce be
 ginners to Python’s beautiful but sometimes peculiar implementation of O
 OP concepts. It’s ideal for people who have a bit of Python knowledge an
 d experience\, and need to move from first steps to a deeper understanding
 .\n\nPlease bring your own laptop\, as the workshop includes hands-on exer
 cises. The minimum setup is a running Python console (preferably Python 3\
 , but Python 2 is also OK) and your editor of choice.\n\nThe recommended s
 etup is a running Jupyter Notebook installation (<http://jupyter.org/>).\n
 \nThere will be no time to install software during the workshop\, so pleas
 e ensure that everything is already working for you. Run this example prog
 ram from Dive Into Python 3 to check that all’s in order: <http://www.di
 veintopython3.net/your-first-python-program.html>\n\nYou can use this code
  to get a working Jupyter Notebook environment:\n\n    virtualenv venv3 -p
  python3\n    source venv3/bin/activate\n    pip install jupyter\n\nThis r
 epository contains the code that will be used during the workshop\n\n<http
 s://github.com/lgiordani/oopy>\n\nThe `PyConUK2016/code` directory contain
 s the Python2 and Python3 code formatted in a way that allows to copy and 
 paste it in a Python console.\n\nThe `PyConUK2016/notebooks` diretory cont
 ains Jupyter notebooks for Python3 only.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:\nThis is a workshop targeted at beginners\, and introduces an 
 applied approach to solving problems with code\, using [Open Data](https:/
 /en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data).\n\nThis workshop starts from the assump
 tion that small projects related to real-world issues can provide directio
 n and scope for learning and exploration. With a few simple tools in Pytho
 n\, and access to a range of Open Data sources\, we can ask some questions
  about the socio-political context we live in\, and move towards answers t
 o those questions.\n\nWe'll take a narrative approach to this\, using [Jup
 yter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/l
 atest/what_is_jupyter.html) as our problem-solving environment\, which req
 uires less overhead than full stack development tooling\, and allows us to
  focus on the content of our exploration\, rather than code design and arc
 hitecture.\n\nIn addition to walking through some simple examples\, we'll 
 discuss other project ideas that can be pursued with Python\, Open Data\, 
 and an inquisitive mind!\n\nThe workshop will have a set of Jupyter Notebo
 oks with simple\, real world examples of common code we need to write to w
 ork with and gain insights out of Open Data. While not strictly required f
 or workshop attendance\, it will be useful to have these set up on your ma
 chine to follow along. For this\, you'll need to have [Python 3](https://w
 ww.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) installed in a
 dvance.\n\nThe Notebooks for the workshop will be [published here](https:/
 /github.com/pwalsh/notebooks/tree/master/opendataprojects) the day prior.\

 \n- having fun with neural networks\; some of the fun techniques that have
  been demonstrated in the last couple of years\n\nPrior knowledge of linea

DESCRIPTION:Machine learning methods can present new possibilities for rese
 arch topics looking at identifying genetic aetiologies of disease. However
  in complex disorders\, such as those seen in psychiatric conditions\, thi
 s can be especially hard given the loosely defined phenotype classificatio
 ns of the diseases.\n\nIn this study\, I examine how well the different ke
 rnel methods for Support Vector Machines do when trying to perform a binar
 y classification on phenotypes that have been simulated from genotyped gen
 etic data in schizophrenia cases and controls. These simulated phenotypes 
 were made from different aspects of the data\, either the main-effects or 
 pairwise interactions between different mutations. The advantage of using 
 simulated phenotypes over real case/control status is that now\, the aetio
 logy of the binary outcomes is known. The results show that when interacti
 ons between 20% of the inputs features are included\, any small contributi
 on of these are detectable when using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel
  in a Support Vector Machine when compared with the performance of a linea
 r kernel.\n\nThese results show that the different performances of the RBF
  and linear kernels can be used to detect the presence of pairwise interac
 tions between features\, even when the effect sizes of these are only marg
 inally larger in size than the main-effects.\n

DESCRIPTION:A lot of interesting problems are computationally hard: Travell
 ing salesmen\, colouring graphs\, packing knapsack. These are all what's c
 alled "NP-hard"\, which most people usually hear as meaning "intractable".
 \n\nBut actually we have good tools for solving specific NP hard problems\
 , and most NP hard problems can be reduced to them. When you do this it tu
 rns out that although there are pathological cases\, most individual insta
 nces of NP hard problems you're likely to encounter are quite tractable in
  practice.\n\nAmongst these  tools are Mixed Integer Linear Programming so
 lvers. There are high quality open source implementations (and amazing pro
 prietary ones)\, and they're actually much easier to use than you might ex
 pect.\n\nWe'll start with a quick overview of the idea of NP-hardness and 
 introduce some common NP-hard problems. We'll then see how to transform th
 ese problems into forms we can feed to a solver. We'll finish with some pr
 actical examples of how this sort of thing can be useful in day to day pro
 blems.

DESCRIPTION:Queueing systems dominate our day-to-day life: for example supe
 rmarkets\, airports\, traffic systems\, and call centres\, naming only a f
 ew obvious examples. A better understanding of these queues can help busin
 esses and service providers optimise these systems\, improving efficiency\
 , profit and satisfaction levels. Sometimes some unintuitive behaviour can
  arise\, and so modelling and investigating queues mathematically has beco
 me very popular and important. One prominent method of doing so is by usin
 g computer simulation.\n\nThis talk will present Ciw\, a new Python librar
 y for simulating open queueing networks. This talk will demonstrate using 
 Ciw's simple interface to model and simulate a queueing system\, and an ov
 erview of it's many features will also be given.\n\nThe library is current
 ly being used in two academic settings: one theoretical project that inves
 tigates queueing networks that deadlock\, and another practical project in
  which patient flows are modelled in an ophthalmology clinic. Synopses of 
 these projects and their results will be discussed.

DESCRIPTION:I'm interested in *optimal addition chains*. These first seemed
  to me like an adding game with only one rule: you can only use numbers yo
 u’ve used before\, and you have to start at 1.\n\nWhat if I were to ask 
 you how many additions we needed to get to 4?  Well  1 + 1 = 2  and  2 + 2
  = 4\, which is clearly 2 equations. Now try to get to 172\, and do it wit
 h as few additions as possible. This is where the problem begins.\n\nThis 
 talk will explore the various methods one can use to calculate optimal add
 ition chains. We will look at why many intuitive solutions don’t work (n
 o matter how hard I tried)\, and why there is not yet an efficient solutio
 n.\n\nThe final part looks at the Scholz Conjecture\, the most famous unso
 lved problem related to addition chains\, and one way you can use Python t
 o show whether it is true for specific numbers.

DESCRIPTION:Last September I (Ben) wrote some code which aimed to make GPIO
  programming much simpler to teach\, and a few of us sprinted on it at PyC
 on UK. Dave contributed some excellent features and we published a few bet
 as early on\, and a couple of months later v1.0 of the library was release
 d: GPIO Zero.\n\nLike Daniel Pope's PyGame Zero\, this library aims for mi
 nimal boilerplate code required to get stared\, and makes progression from
  simple scripts to more advanced applications simple.\n\nThis talk focuses
  on the story of the library's development. It was built collaboratively b
 etween the two of us (remotely)\, with most of the discussion\, API design
  and decision making taking place in GitHub issues. We introduced some ver
 y complex Python code to the codebase in the name of making the API more u
 ser friendly\, and it had great results from teachers and kids.\n

 across the world\, from a prison in Kenya to hundreds of schools across Eu

 mentation for educators (many complete beginners to Linux) and how this wa
 s a complete shock to me (a teenage programmer). I will end the talk with 
 a dive into the underlying technologies and how Python and Bash can be mad

DESCRIPTION:Testing is a cornerstone of modern software development.  It pr
 ovides us with a safety net against bugs and regressions – without testi
 ng\, it would be impossible to write large-scale applications.\n\nThe trad
 itional approach to testing relies on hard-coded examples: fire some speci
 fic inputs into a function\, and compare the result to predetermined\, exp
 ected output.  This means somebody has to think of examples to test\, but 
 humans are notoriously bad at coming up with random data.  So why not let 
 the computer do it for us?\n\nIn this talk\, you'll learn about property-b
 ased testing.  You tell the computer what sort of test data to use\, and l
 et it fill in the blanks.  This allows the computer to try many\, many mor
 e examples than you could write by hand.  It's a great way to find bugs in
  your software – before they reach your users.\n\nWe'll see this style o
 f testing through the lens of Hypothesis\, a property-based testing librar
 y with Hypothesis.  I'll show you how this style of testing works\, some f
 eatures of Hypothesis\, and some testing patterns that let you apply this 
 in your own code.\n\nPushing this a little further\, I'll introduce the id
 ea of stateful testing.  You don't even need to write a test: you just tel
 l Hypothesis how to use your program\, and it goes off and tries to break 
 it in interesting ways.\n

DESCRIPTION:Microservices is the popular term for the trend to build backen
 d\narchitectures as a number of smaller independent processes.  As an\nevo
 lution from the Service Oriented Architecture the core aims are to\ncreate
  independent services which are easy to operate and even replace\nwhile al
 l of them together compose into providing the business logic\nrequired for
  your application.\n\nWhile it is rather common for microservices to choos
 e JSON over HTTP\nto communicate with each other\, this is purely an imple
 mentation\nchoice.  HTTP is a protocol using a strict request-response for
 mat\,\nthis can become a little burdensome when needing to deal with\nasyn
 chronous requests and forces some architectural decisions to be\nnot as id
 eal as they could be.  ZeroMQ has more flexible communication\npatterns al
 lowing for easier mapping of real-life interactions between\nservices.  Co
 upled with an easy to use asynchronous user-level API and\nvery fast under
 lying communication on persistent TCP connections\nZeroMQ is a rather attr
 active transport to build your microservices\nbased applications in.\n\nTh
 is talk will show how to use ZeroMQ within Python to build your\nmicroserv
 ices.  It will show the benefits of ZeroMQ's asynchronous\nAPI\, common us
 age patterns and how to handle backpressure.\nFurthermore different commun
 ication patterns will be explored and the\nimpact this has on how to simpl
 ify the overall architecture using\nthese patterns.\n

DESCRIPTION:We're lucky with Python that we can concentrate on getting the 
 job done and often don't have to worry about how fast our code runs. Those
  of us without computer science degrees really know how to appreciate this
 . And 9 times out of 10 you probably don't need to worry at all about the 
 speed: if the program takes 10 minutes to run but saves you hours of work 
 then it's a job well done. But then there is that 10th time…\n\nBased on
  work done over the last couple of years with openpyxl I will show some ti
 ps and tricks as to how you can approach improving performance without hav
 ing to become a mathematical genius or computer whizz. There is lots of go
 od advice about performance around but it has to make sense within the con
 text of your application: does it matter that Python loops are considered 
 slow? What kind of a role does memory play?\n\nThe talk will cover using t
 ests and profiling to identify the areas that you need to work on\, stop y
 ou breaking stuff irreparably\, and what things you might want to research
  or ask about. I do promise you: the art of performance really is the art 
 of doing nothing!

DESCRIPTION:Python seems like an executable pseudo code. It has unique stre
 ngths and charms that can be hard to grasp. Programmers familiar with othe
 r languages may try to write Python as if it’s C++\, Java\, or whatever 
 they know best. It’s important for everyone to know—the Pythonic—way
  to do the most common things in Python. Python philosophy suggests to be 
 explicit\, to choose simple over complex\, and to maximise readability.\n\
 nIn this talk\, I am going to share my story of switching from a C-family 
 language to Python. What Pythonic thinking means here is that understandin
 g python implementations\, dynamic language structure\, supported programm
 ing styles\, data structures and functional extensions. The more you learn
  the strength of Python language the more you enjoy coding.\n

DESCRIPTION:Everything from a lack of teachers to dysfunctional computer la
 bs has led to a loss of interest in Junior Computer studies learners regis
 tering for the subject in their senior grades. These has led to yet a bigg
 er problem which is what I want to address in my talk. PYNAM is short for 
 Python Namibia. It is a Python programming society. We established PYNAM d
 uring the Feb 2015 PyCon Namibia conference. We primarily aim at bringing 
 the Python Community in Namibia together and to promote Python to the youn
 g children through our school outreach programs. This year we are hosting 
 a first ever programming day where the learners get to showcase their soft
 ware and also raise money to help fix the computer lab at the school. My t
 alk will report about the programs that the learners will create\, the who
 le experience of developing the systems and organizing the event.

DESCRIPTION:This talk is aimed at developers who want to use machine learni
 ng to solve their own binary (2 class) classification task. No prior machi
 ne learning or math experience is required. This talk will cover feature e
 ngineering (including a robust solution to 'the problem of null data')\, p
 redicting the right class with a Random Forest\, cross-validating to avoid
  over-fitting\, diagnosing problems in the classifier and approaches to de
 ploying the classifier in the real world. My goal is to provide you with a
  process that you can take back to the office to try with your own data. I
 t'll be backed by reproducible working code.

DESCRIPTION:An in-house data processing API/toolbox has been developed for 
 research scientists at a nuclear fusion startup. The aim of the toolbox is
  to help scientists across the company increase the efficiency\, reproduci
 bility and robustness of processing data from physical experiments and num
 erical simulations. The toolbox is designed to provide a unified workflow 
 for both simulations and experiments.\n\nTo achieve this goal\, where user
  python experience ranges from beginner to professional\, we undertook an 
 iterative architectural design and development strategy\, with a high leve
 l of user engagement. In this talk\, we outline our approach for gathering
  requirements\, a selection of user stories\, and the architectural decisi
 ons that enabled the toolbox to achieve its goals with a high user uptake.

DESCRIPTION:Testing is a best practice for delivering reliable software\, b
 ut it can be a hard subject when starting out. What should you test and wh
 y? How much testing is enough? So you spent three days and wrote out tests
  for everything in your module\, but was that an effective use of your tim
 e?\nThis talk will give an overview of the different layers that you can w
 rite tests for and why you should have them. You start with unit tests\, m
 ix in some integration tests\, and cover with acceptance tests. Sprinkle w
 ith specific testing tools to taste. Tools we’ll discuss include py.test
 \, docker\, behave\, tox\, and coverage. Although the talk focus will be o
 n web apps\, the ideas will be relevant to all Python applications.\nWriti
 ng quality tests is important: flaky tests will cost more time than they s
 ave and filler tests that don’t test important areas will weigh you down
  over time. With stable and effective tests for all layers\, you build cod
 e you can trust\, that you can refactor quickly or change easily without b
 reaking everything. It’s as easy as cake!

 . While some of the ideas carry over straightforwardly\, both the way data
  analysis is typically developed and the nature of data analysis tasks mea

DESCRIPTION:The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) is the world’s reposi
 tory for small molecule organic and metal-organic crystal structures\, a v
 aluable resource for structural chemistry research and education. Explorat
 ion and application of knowledge derived from these crystal structures is 
 enabled by a widely-used suite of software tools.\n\nThis software consist
 s of more than 4 million lines of C++\, plus substantial amounts of code i
 n other languages\, developed over 25 years. Sophisticated GUIs allow scie
 ntists to perform very specific tasks effectively\, but limit innovation b
 eyond these pre-defined tasks. Furthermore\, the learning curve for this t
 echnology is significant. A consequence is that valuable data\, and the sc
 ientific tools built on that data\, is inaccessible to many of the scienti
 sts who would benefit most.\n   \nTo provide more flexible access to the C
 SD and the C++ toolkit upon which the associated software tools are built\
 , we developed the CSD Python API. It offers elegant\, and simple to use\,
  Python modules for programmatically accessing both the CSD data and scien
 tific functionality. Python is a widely adopted programming language in th
 e scientific community that\, despite its powerful features\, is reasonabl
 y easy to learn and use by non-programmers. It also facilitates integratio
 n with other widely used scientific tools.\n\nThis case study will explain
  how we built the CSD Python API\, and some of the lessons we learnt along
  the way. It will describe how the CSD Python API is revolutionising state
 -of-the-art structural chemistry research\, and has opened scientific and 
 development opportunities that were previously unavailable. Come to this p
 resentation to learn how a large and daunting code-base can be tamed by la
 yering on a friendly API.\n

DESCRIPTION:Imagine the situation: You’ve written some wonderful Python c
 ode which produces a beautiful output: a graph\, some wonderful data\, a l
 ovely musical composition\, or whatever. You save that output\, naturally 
 enough\, as awesome_output.png. You run the code a couple of times\, each 
 time making minor modifications. You come back to it the next week/month/y
 ear. Do you know how you created that output? What input data? What versio
 n of your code? If you’re anything like me then the answer will often\, 
 frustratingly\, be “no”.\n\nThis talk will introduce ReciPy\, a Python
  module that will save you from this situation! With the addition of a sin
 gle line of code to the top of your Python files\, ReciPy will log each ru
 n of your code to a database\, keeping track of all of your input files\, 
 output files and the code that was used - as well as a lot of other useful
  information. You can then query this easily and find out exactly how that
  output was created.\n\nReciPy was originally developed at the Collaborati
 ons Workshop 2015 Hack Day\, run by the Software Sustainability Institute 
 - a UK-based institute focused on improving the way that computational sci
 ence is carried out. ReciPy won the Hack Day competition\, and has been de
 veloped further to make it fully useable\, even by novice programmers - an
 d even by those outside of computational science.\n\nReciPy is built of th
 ree separate components: a Python module that hooks into the Python import
  system so that it can ‘monkey patch’ input/output functions to write 
 to a log before actually doing the input/output\, a database stored in Mon
 goDB and a range of interfaces to allow you to find out exactly how you di
 d produce that output.\n\nThis talk will be suitable for programmers at al
 l levels: you will hear how to install and use ReciPy and how it will help
  you (novice)\, how it hooks into Python (intermediate/advanced) and how y
 ou can help with further development (intermediate/advanced)

DESCRIPTION:It is natural for small software teams to unknowingly build up 
 a monolith application with their development\, one that becomes a single 
 point of failure.  Symptoms often include exceedingly long test suites for
  code with disparate functionalities\, tight coupling between various part
 s of the applications\, and the stress from worrying about breaking the wh
 ole monolith as a result of deploys of small changes.  As the services of 
 the application grow\, there are several advantages to breaking up the mon
 olith into smaller and more manageable microservices.  Dockerized containe
 rs for Python APIs prove to be a great way to ship these microservices.  T
 his talk divulges the lessons learned from such a breakup as well as the v
 ery real emotional difficulties and ultimate benefits of breaking up an en
 gineering team into agile cross-functional teams.\n
