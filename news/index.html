            <h2>Conference Code of Conduct report</h2>

            <a href="/news/20160919-coc/">19th September 2016</a>
            <div class="textblock">
              
              <p>PyCon UK 2016 ran for five days and was host to well over 500 attendees.</p>

<p>On the final day of talks, we received two complaints that were treated as
<em>Code of Conduct</em> issues.</p>

<p>Both concerned discourteous remarks made during the questions after a
speakers' talks.</p>

<p>These issues were addressed at the conference closing session, at which we
reminded audience members that:</p>

<ul>
<li>informing the speaker that she is "doing it wrong"</li>
<li>calling out answers to another person’s question</li>
<li>dismissing another person’s suggestion with “that problem was solved 20 years
ago”</li>
</ul>

<p>are <em>not</em> examples of respectful behaviour and are not welcome at PyCon UK.</p>

<p>We haven't been able to identify the people in question, but we hope they were
present at the closing session and understand that this behaviour doesn't
represent the standards of behaviour that we expect at PyCon UK.</p>

            <a href="/news/20160913-last-email-before-the-conference/">13th September 2016</a>
            <div class="textblock">

<hr />

<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>Just a couple of last-minute practicalities...</p>

<h3>Open Day</h3>

<ul>
<li>Thursday's <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/open-day/">Open Day</a> is at Cardiff University's <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/estat/accessibilityinformation/cathayscampus/butebuilding/buteaccess.html">Bute Building</a>.  This is not in the same venue as the rest of the conference, so please don't turn up at City Hall on Thursday!</li>
<li>If you're coming to the Open Day on Thursday, you need to have a ticket (unless you're taking part in Django Girls) even if you've got a ticket for the rest of the conference.  All tickets have now gone, but there is a <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/open-day/">waiting list</a>.  (It's already quite long though.)</li>
<li>If you've got a ticket for the Open Day (your tickets are listed at the bottom of this email) but you cannot come, please <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/contact/">let us know</a> so that we can assign it to somebody on the waiting list.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Friday registration</h3>

<p>We're expecting 500 people on Friday, most of whom won't have been at Thursday's Open Day.  We're going to have to get as many people registered as possible between 8am and 9am.  Please try to come to <a href="http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/find-us">City Hall</a> as early as you can on Friday.</p>

<h3>Evening dinners</h3>

<p>There are a few tickets left for the <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/conference-dinner/">conference dinner</a> on Friday, and the dinners at <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/the-clink/">the Clink</a> on Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Don't leave it too late to book!  They will sell out.</p>

<h3>And finally...</h3>

<p>We're all really looking forward to welcoming you to the conference.  This will be the biggest PyCon UK ever (by quite a long way) and we're in a new venue.  There are bound to be some teething troubles, so please be patient with us, and look for opportunities to help out.</p>

<p>~ The PyCon UK Committee</p>

<p>With the conference just around the corner, we want to share a few practicalities with you.</p>

<h3>Venue</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/open-day/">Open Day</a> on Thursday will be held in the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/estat/accessibilityinformation/cathayscampus/butebuilding/buteaccess.html">Bute Building</a> at Cardiff University.  Entrance is free and open to everyone, but you'll need a ticket for the Open Day, even if you've already got a ticket for the main conference.</p>

<p>The rest of the conference will be held at <a href="http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/find-us">Cardiff City Hall</a>.</p>

<p>Both venues are accessible for people of limited mobility. If you need to park near the venue because of mobility issues, please contact us and we'll do our best to help.</p>

<h3>Timetable</h3>

<p>The registration desk opens each day at 8am.  We'd encourage you to turn up as early as you can to avoid the rush at 8.55!</p>

<p>Each day's programme starts at 9am.  The Open Day finishes at 4pm, while other days finish at 6.15pm.</p>

<p>You can find the full schedule on the <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/programme/">conference website</a>.</p>

<h3>Evening dinners</h3>

<p>We're hosting the conference dinner at City Hall on the evening of Friday 16th.  The dinner is always a highlight of the conference.  Tickets cost £30, and are <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/conference-dinner/">available here</a>.</p>

<p>On the other evenings, we've booked the restaurant at <a href="http://theclinkcharity.org/the-clink-restaurants/cardiff-wales/">the Clink</a>, and you're invited to join us.  Again, tickets cost £30 and are <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/the-clink/">available on the website</a>.</p>

<h3>Disruption on the trains</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gwr.com/travel-updates/planned-engineering/severn-tunnel">Severn Tunnel will be closed</a> for the duration of the conference, so if you're planning to come by train from London, you'll need to expect a slightly tedious journey!</p>

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>In common with all Python conferences, the conference has a <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>, to which all delegates are expected to conform.  Please make yourself familiar with it.</p>

<h3>Conference Slack team</h3>

<p>We are experimenting with setting up a <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> team for the duration of the conference.  You should receive an email invitation to join the team in the next day or two.</p>

<h3>Workshops</h3>

<p>Some workshops have setup required.  Please check the session descriptions in advance, so that workshops can start promptly.</p>

<h3>Conference WiFi</h3>

<p>We hope that the WiFi at the venue is up to supporting the number of people at the conference.  However, we can't guarantee it, so please try to avoid hogging bandwidth, and if you can, try to bring a device that you can tether from.</p>

<h3>Volunteering</h3>

<p>Would you like to help out at the conference?  We're looking for people to staff the information desk during the morning, to help with filming, and to chair sessions.  If you'd like to help, please <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://djangogirls.org/pyconuk2016/">Django Girls</a> workshop on Thursday is also looking for a couple more coaches.  More information about this is on the <a href="https://djangogirls.org/pyconuk2016/#coach">Django Girls website</a>.</p>

<h3>Children's Day</h3>

<p>There are still some tickets left for our <a href="http://2016.pyconuk.org/children/">children's day</a>.  Why not bring your kids along on Saturday for a fun-packed day of activities and workshops where they can learn all about getting the most out of the world with Python?  Tickets cost just £5.</p>

<h3>Sponsors</h3>

<p>Finally, we'd like to thank all our sponsors for their support.  Without them, we wouldn't be able to put on the conference.  They'll be exhibiting during the conference, so please go and say hello.</p>

<p>See you in Cardiff!</p>

              <p>We were dismayed today to hear news of the health of Rob Collins, who is very seriously ill in hospital and is not
expected to recover.</p>

<p>Rob has been a familiar and friendly face at PyCon UK and other events for several years. He was active in the Python
community, and was behind various initiatives - such as the well-loved EuroPython massages, which continued this year
in his absence, organising a card-signing for John Pinner when John was ill - and of course he was also known for his
talks, which were always insightful and often hilarious.</p>

<p>Rob's generous spirit was appreciated and valued very much in our community. On behalf of everyone in the Python world,
we extend Rob our thanks for his many contributions over the years, and for being a good friend who will be missed.</p>

<p>We're collecting reminiscences and messages of support for Rob. If you have anything you would like to share, please
send them to pyconukorganisers@gmail.com by the end of Saturday.</p>

<p>Our thoughts are with Rob and his family and close friends.</p>

            <div class="textblock">
              
              <p>We're delighted to announce our first keynote speaker, <a href="http://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/gollis">Gail
Ollis</a>.</p>

<p>Gail is not just a programmer, she's also an observer of programmers - of the way they work, think and behave. So, her interest in programming includes the <em>activity</em> of programming.</p>

<p>Her publications and research work are full of observations and insights into the mind of the programmer, and draw upon
a wide range of references to help illuminate what goes on when programmers get to work.</p>

<p>Her talk for us at this year's PyCon UK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Folklore and fantasy in the information age</strong></p>
  
  <p>Software development is not easy.</p>
  
  <p>As grown-ups we know better than to believe that difficult things can be achieved
  by a simple wave of a magic wand, yet faith persists that this new idea, that new tool, will make all the
  difference.</p>
  
  <p>Meanwhile for the hard-bitten cynics it is all the emperor's new clothes. I invite you to join me in a
  more constructive realm between belief and cynicism, where we can embrace the power of stories, listen with an open
  mind, but not be bewitched by the expectation of a fairy-tale ending.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This talk is one not to be missed by the reflective programmer.</p>

applications close on 7th July, so you need to be quick.</p>

<p>These funds are available to anyone who attends KatieConf on the 31st June. KatieConf is <strong>free</strong> and open to all, and
if you are not doing anything else that day then it must mean you are at KatieConf!</p>

<p>Please tell us why you're attending KatieConf.</p>

<p>You don't have to be a Katie to benefit from these funds, but it might help. KatieConf speakers will be given priority
in the selection process. Applicants will be notified as early as possible.</p>

<p>Good luck! Have fun at KatieConf, and see you at PyCon.</p>

              <p>On Saturday 17th September, we're hosting a fun-packed day of activities and
workshops for children to learn all about getting the most out of the world
with Python.</p>

<p>We're working with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and some of the team who
brought Python to the Micro:bit will be coming along to show you how use Python
to write games. There'll be a chance to play with robots, and to learn how to
program Minecraft with Python!</p>

<p>Tickets for children cost £5, and include lunch.</p>

            <h2>Help build a supercomputer in a briefcase</h2>

            <a href="/news/20160618-supercomputer-briefcase/">18th June 2016</a>
            <div class="textblock">
              
              <p>Join <a href="https://www.russel.org.uk/stories/short-biography.html">Russel Winder</a>'s project at PyCon UK 2016 to develop a
new open-source supercomputer, based on Raspberry Pis in clusters.</p>

<p>The project has a number of aims. One is to come up with a design that others can easily adopt and work with, so it's not a
one-off project but something that will have enduring benefit.</p>

<p>Another is to give people a practical hands-on introduction to working in friendly company with the techniques involved.</p>

<p>Finally (this is Russel's <em>hidden agenda</em> , so don't tell anyone) the project aims to create something that can be used
in schools to introduce parallelism and concurrency.</p>

<p>Much of the work will cover the software required to set up ad-hoc clusters, but there will be some hardware issues
to tackle too.</p>

<p>Russel will introduce the project in a talk on our <a href="/introduction/">open day</a>, and hold a planning and introduction
session that day. On <a href="/code-day/">Monday</a> work on the project will begin in earnest during the sprints.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone's welcome</strong>. You don't need to be an expert or an advanced programmer to join in. It's meant to be a fun
project and an opportunity to learn. However, if you have an <em>actual briefcase</em> and some skills that would help make
the finished project look impressive, you'll be especially warmly welcomed...</p>

<p>You can just turn up and join in, but you can also <a href="https://www.russel.org.uk/stories/contact.html">contact Russel</a> if
you'd like to help plan the project.</p>

<p>Don't forget to bring your Raspberry Pis with you.</p>

<h3>Do you have an idea for an activity at PyCon UK?</h3>

<p>Our <a href="/cfp/">Call for proposals</a> will be closing soon - on the 28th June.</p>

            <h2>Our Call for Proposals - an update</h2>

            <a href="/news/20160616-proposals/">16th June 2016</a>
            <div class="textblock">
              
              <p>Our <a href="/cfp/">Call for Proposals</a> will be closing soon - on the 28th June.</p>

<p>If you're thinking about submitting a proposal for a talk, workshop or other activity - please do! And do please get
in touch with us to discuss your proposal if you think that would help.</p>

<p>Don't forget that we have a <a href="/speaker-mentors/">Speaker mentor programme</a> to help first-time speakers or anyone else
who would benefit from some help of that kind.</p>

<p>In order to encourage you, here are five speakers we've chosen as a preview in advance of the final selection:</p>

<h3>Cat Lamin, <em>Why do kids need to code and how can we help?</em></h3>

<p><a href="https://teachprimarycomputing.wordpress.com">Cat</a> is a maths and computing teacher, with huge enthusiasm for programming and technology, and an awareness of some of
the problems in computing education: "There is a huge disparity between expectations for teaching computing and what
teachers actually know how to do".</p>

<h3>Thomas Campbell, <em>Using Python for National Cipher Challenge</em></h3>

<p>Thomas is a high-school pupil, for whom Python has already unlocked several doors (almost literally, in cryptography)
and presents many more opportunities as a tool for exploring the world.</p>

<h3>Yulia Zozulya, <em>From QA to UX - Learning how to accommodate developers</em></h3>

<p>Yulia works at <a href="http://jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a>, producers of one of the most widely-used of all Python development
tools, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>, so she gets some very clear insights into how developers behave
when they're users; she'll share these and discuss the challenge of creating tools for this special class of users.</p>

<h3>Gusztav Belteki, <em>Python in Medicine: ventilator data</em></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.belteki.co.uk">Gusztav</a> is a consultant neonatologist, with expertise in the computer-controlled ventilators
that assist the breathing of very ill new-born babies. He's a self-described Python hobbyist, with no programming
background, but has been using Python to explore and analyse the vast amounts of useful data these machines produce to
improve patient outcomes.</p>

<h3>Zara Siddique, <em>Addition - well, that escalated quickly</em></h3>

<p>Zara is a mathematician, and she uses Python as a computing tool of choice to tackle mathematical problems. Maths is
filled with apparently simple problems that rapidly turn out to be not simple at all. Addition is one of them. Zara
will discuss amongst other things the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholz_conjecture">Scholz Conjecture</a> and how
she has used Python to explore it.</p>

<h3>What about you?</h3>

<p>You too could be speaking at PyCon UK. The last thing you need to be is an expert: all you need is to have something
interesting to say.</p>

you can now <a href="/tickets/upgrading/">purchase an upgrade</a>.</p>
