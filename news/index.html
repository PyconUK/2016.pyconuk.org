            <h2>Our friend Rob Collins</h2>

            <a href="/news/20160726-rob-collins/">26th July 2016</a>
            <div class="textblock">
              
              <p>We were dismayed today to hear news of the health of Rob Collins, who is very seriously ill in hospital and is not
expected to recover.</p>

<p>Rob has been a familiar and friendly face at PyCon UK and other events for several years. He was active in the Python
community, and was behind various initiatives - such as the well-loved EuroPython massages, which continued this year
in his absence, organising a card-signing for John Pinner when John was ill - and of course he was also known for his
talks, which were always insightful and often hilarious.</p>

<p>Rob's generous spirit was appreciated and valued very much in our community. On behalf of everyone in the Python world,
we extend Rob our thanks for his many contributions over the years, and for being a good friend who will be missed.</p>

<p>We're collecting reminiscences and messages of support for Rob. If you have anything you would like to share, please
send them to pyconukorganisers@gmail.com by the end of Saturday.</p>

<p>Our thoughts are with Rob and his family and close friends.</p>

            <h2>Our keynote speaker, Gail Ollis</h2>

            <a href="/news/20160702-gail-ollis-keynote/">2nd July 2016</a>
            <div class="textblock">
              
              <p>We're delighted to announce our first keynote speaker, <a href="http://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/gollis">Gail
Ollis</a>.</p>

<p>Gail is not just a programmer, she's also an observer of programmers - of the way they work, think and behave. So, her interest in programming includes the <em>activity</em> of programming.</p>

<p>Her publications and research work are full of observations and insights into the mind of the programmer, and draw upon
a wide range of references to help illuminate what goes on when programmers get to work.</p>

<p>Her talk for us at this year's PyCon UK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Folklore and fantasy in the information age</strong></p>
  
  <p>Software development is not easy.</p>
  
  <p>As grown-ups we know better than to believe that difficult things can be achieved
  by a simple wave of a magic wand, yet faith persists that this new idea, that new tool, will make all the
  difference.</p>
  
  <p>Meanwhile for the hard-bitten cynics it is all the emperor's new clothes. I invite you to join me in a
  more constructive realm between belief and cynicism, where we can embrace the power of stories, listen with an open
  mind, but not be bewitched by the expectation of a fairy-tale ending.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This talk is one not to be missed by the reflective programmer.</p>

            <div class="textblock">
              
              <p>Tomorrow, the <strong>31st June</strong> is a momentous day: the first-ever <a href="http://katieconf.xyz">KatieConf</a>!</p>

<p>We've received £500 from the Django Society UK to help celebrate this remarkable event. This £500 will be used to
help a KatieConf attendee (or attendees) come to PyCon UK in September.</p>

<p>Apply using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JWdkK4pP-USm3duQ-mXdQ6rYEp05lrmqMQ0sSCA5JXw/viewform">the
financial assistance form</a>. Katies are well-known as fast-movers who get things done and make things happen -
applications close on 7th July, so you need to be quick.</p>

<p>These funds are available to anyone who attends KatieConf on the 31st June. KatieConf is <strong>free</strong> and open to all, and
if you are not doing anything else that day then it must mean you are at KatieConf!</p>

<p>Please tell us why you're attending KatieConf.</p>

<p>You don't have to be a Katie to benefit from these funds, but it might help. KatieConf speakers will be given priority
in the selection process. Applicants will be notified as early as possible.</p>

<p>Good luck! Have fun at KatieConf, and see you at PyCon.</p>

              <p>Join <a href="https://www.russel.org.uk/stories/short-biography.html">Russel Winder</a>'s project at PyCon UK 2016 to develop a
new open-source supercomputer, based on Raspberry Pis in clusters.</p>

<p>The project has a number of aims. One is to come up with a design that others can easily adopt and work with, so it's not a
one-off project but something that will have enduring benefit.</p>

<p>Another is to give people a practical hands-on introduction to working in friendly company with the techniques involved.</p>

<p>Finally (this is Russel's <em>hidden agenda</em> , so don't tell anyone) the project aims to create something that can be used
in schools to introduce parallelism and concurrency.</p>

<p>Much of the work will cover the software required to set up ad-hoc clusters, but there will be some hardware issues
to tackle too.</p>

<p>Russel will introduce the project in a talk on our <a href="/introduction/">open day</a>, and hold a planning and introduction
session that day. On <a href="/code-day/">Monday</a> work on the project will begin in earnest during the sprints.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone's welcome</strong>. You don't need to be an expert or an advanced programmer to join in. It's meant to be a fun
project and an opportunity to learn. However, if you have an <em>actual briefcase</em> and some skills that would help make
the finished project look impressive, you'll be especially warmly welcomed...</p>

<p>You can just turn up and join in, but you can also <a href="https://www.russel.org.uk/stories/contact.html">contact Russel</a> if
you'd like to help plan the project.</p>

<p>Don't forget to bring your Rasberry Pis with you.</p>

<h3>Do you have an idea for an activity at PyCon UK?</h3>

<p>Our <a href="/cfp/">Call for proposals</a> will be closing soon - on the 28th June.</p>

            <div class="textblock">
              
              <p>Our <a href="/cfp/">Call for Proposals</a> will be closing soon - on the 28th June.</p>

<p>If you're thinking about submitting a proposal for a talk, workshop or other activity - please do! And do please get
in touch with us to discuss your proposal if you think that would help.</p>

<p>Don't forget that we have a <a href="/speaker-mentors/">Speaker mentor programme</a> to help first-time speakers or anyone else
who would benefit from some help of that kind.</p>

<p>In order to encourage you, here are five speakers we've chosen as a preview in advance of the final selection:</p>

<h3>Cat Lamin, <em>Why do kids need to code and how can we help?</em></h3>

<p><a href="https://teachprimarycomputing.wordpress.com">Cat</a> is a maths and computing teacher, with huge enthusiasm for programming and technology, and an awareness of some of
the problems in comupting education: "There is a huge disparity between expectations for teaching computing and what
teachers actually know how to do".</p>

<h3>Thomas Campbell, <em>Using Python for National Cipher Challenge</em></h3>

<p>Thomas is a high-school pupil, for whom Python has already unlocked several doors (almost literally, in cryptography)
and presents many more opportunities as a tool for exploring the world.</p>

<h3>Yulia Zozulya, <em>From QA to UX - Learning how to accommodate developers</em></h3>

<p>Yulia works at <a href="http://jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a>, producers of one of the most widely-used of all Python development
tools, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>, so she gets some very clear insights into how developers behave
when they're users; she'll share these and discuss the challenge of creating tools for this special class of users.</p>

<h3>Gusztav Belteki, <em>Python in Medicine: ventilator data</em></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.belteki.co.uk">Gusztav</a> is a consultant neonatologist, with expertise in the computer-controlled ventilators
that assist the breathing of very ill new-born babies. He's a self-described Python hobbyist, with no programming
background, but has been using Python to explore and analyse the vast amounts of useful data these machines produce to
improve patient outcomes.</p>

<h3>Zara Siddique, <em>Addition - well, that escalated quickly</em></h3>

<p>Zara is a mathematician, and she uses Python as a computing tool of choice to tackle mathematical problems. Maths is
filled with apparently simple problems that rapidly turn out to be not simple at all. Addition is one of them. Zara
will discuss amongst other things the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholz_conjecture">Scholz Conjecture</a> and how
she has used Python to explore it.</p>

<h3>What about you?</h3>

<p>You too could be speaking at PyCon UK. The last thing you need to be is an expert: all you need is to have something
interesting to say.</p>
