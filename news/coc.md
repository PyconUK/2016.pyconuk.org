title: Conference Code of Conduct report
date: 2016-09-19
---
PyCon UK 2016 ran for five days and was host to well over 500 attendees.

On the final day of talks, we received two complaints that were treated as
*Code of Conduct* issues.

Both concerned discourteous remarks made during the questions after a
speakers' talks.

These issues were addressed at the conference closing session, at which we
reminded audience members that:

* informing the speaker that she is "doing it wrong"
* calling out answers to another person’s question
* dismissing another person’s suggestion with “that problem was solved 20 years
  ago”

are *not* examples of respectful behaviour and are not welcome at PyCon UK.

We haven't been able to identify the people in question, but we hope they were
present at the closing session and understand that this behaviour doesn't
represent the standards of behaviour that we expect at PyCon UK.
