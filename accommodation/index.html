        <h2>Hotels</h2>

<h3>Recommended partner hotels</h3>

<p>The hotels listed in this section have given us preferential rates or terms or both. Their allocation of rooms for
PyCon UK attendees is likely to be exhausted well before the conference, so <strong>you are stongly advised to book as early
as you can</strong>.</p>

<p>Note that depending upon availability you may well be able to find cheaper rates than these, but on
less flexible terms (changes and cancellation not permitted).</p>

<p>Other hotels are listed after these.</p>

<p>Cardiff is a small city, and the weekend of PyCon UK will be busy. The longer you leave it to book your accommodation, the more difficult it will be to get it at a good price.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: if you find that the prices your are offered don't match the rates advertised below, that means that
they are simply no longer available. We don't have a contract with the hotels, and once the room allocations are gone,
they're gone.</p>

<h3>Use booking sites</h3>

<p>Check sites such as <a href="http://hotels.com">Hotels.com</a> and <a href="http://booking.com">Booking.com</a> for other hotels. (Apparently
if you put your browser into private or incognito mode, you can sometimes get different, better, prices. Who knows?)</p>

<p>Some hotels don’t even appear on those sites, never mind offer discounts to Pythonistas; you need to go to their
websites directly and pay the same as everyone else:</p>

<h3>Travelodge Hotels</h3>

<p>There are several <a href="https://www.travelodge.co.uk">Travelodge hotels</a> in Cardiff, including one very close to City Hall
and one very close to Cardiff Central Railway station.</p>

<h3>Premier Inn</h3>

<p>There's a <a href="http://www.premierinn.com/">Premier Inn</a> on Churchill Way, about ten minutes' walk from City Hall.</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>There are hotels and guest-houses along Cathedral Road, a not unpleasant (this can depend upon what the weather
has to offer) walk away from City Hall through Bute Park.</p>

<p>Consult <a href="http://www.wimdu.com/">Wimdu</a> and <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/">Airbnb</a>.</p>

<h2>Get the location right</h2>

<p>You'll have most fun at PyCon UK if you're staying somewhere a short walk from City Hall. Here's a <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Cardiff+City+Hall/@51.4813123,-3.1780703,16z/data=!4m9!1m6!2m5!1shotel!3m3!1
