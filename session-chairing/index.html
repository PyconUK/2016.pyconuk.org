        <h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Session chairs have an extremely valuable role in the smooth running of a conference. Your responsibility is to manage a room for a given run of talks. You are responsible for the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Helping the speakers feel comfortable and sure of themselves.</li>
<li>Acting as a conduit between the speaker and the audience, helping the audience get the most value from the sessions.</li>
<li>Making sure that the session, and therefore the conference, runs on time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Checklist</h2>

<p>To help do this, we've put together a small checklist of things you should do as a session chair. Read over them, and note them down somewhere: they'll help you make PyCon UK 2016 a fantastic conference!</p>

<ol>
<li>Arrive to your session early! It's important that sessions start on time, and they can only do that if the chair is present!</li>
<li><p>Before each talk in your session begins, introduce yourself to the speaker. You need to find out some information from them:</p>

<ol>
<li>How should you pronounce their name? It's embarrassing to pronouce a speaker's name incorrectly: confirm with the speaker how they'd like their name pronounced!</li>
<li>Check whether the speaker wants questions during their talk, after the talk, or not at all.</li>
<li><p>Inform the speaker of how much time they will have to <em>speak</em>, taking the questions into account. In a 30 minute slot, there are 25 minutes of content and five minutes of switchover time; in a 45 minute slot there are 40 minutes of content and five minutes of switchover time.</p>

<p>Note that, if the speaker wants to take questions at the end, they'll usually want five minutes for questions. This means that a speaker will <em>speak</em> for 20 minutes in a 30 minute slot, and 35 minutes in a 45 minute slot.</p>

<p>It's extremely important that speakers keep to their time slot, and making sure they know how much time is available to them before they start helps.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li>At the start of the slot, introduce the speaker to the audience. Tell the audience whether there will be questions, and if they can ask questions during the talk or not.</li>
<li><p>Count the speaker down for their speaking time. Give them five and one minute warnings, and then flag them when their speaking time is over.</p>

<p>Don't <em>stop</em> a speaker until they're at the session time limit (25 minutes for a 30 minute slot, 40 minutes for a 45 minute slot). If a speaker is speaking past their time limit you <em>must</em> stop them. Give them 20 seconds to wrap up, but the five minute handover period must be respected.</p></li>
<li>When the speaker has finished, you're in charge of running the questions (if there are any).
<ol>
<li>Before beginning, tell the audience that you'll only accept <em>actual</em> questions. Statements and advertisements for personal projects should be done after the session.</li>
<li>When questions are asked, ensure that the audience can hear them: repeat them if needed.</li>
<li>Make sure questions are appropriate. If they aren't, feel free to use your authority to take another question.</li>
<li>If no-one else is prepared to ask the first question, you should!</li>
</ol></li>
<li>When there's only 5 minutes left in the session, call it to a close. Thank the speaker!</li>
</ol>

<p>This seems like a lot, but it's mostly fairly simple. Keep track of your responsibilities, and everything will go smoothly. Enjoy your sessions!</p>
